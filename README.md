Documentation for my Bachelor thesis project: MXylo: Xylophone MIDI Controller

MXylo is a USB MIDI Controller designed to be played like a Xylophone would.



The project is using ESP-IDF framework for low level communication (adc, usb and i2c), as well as standard RTOS for various tasks such as polling peripherals, displaying UI on an LCD display and controlling note length.
